# This is a demo file showing how to create a PR (Pull Request) to the project you clone:
  1. Fork a repo from the people you follow or project you're interested in (called original project in the following discussion).
     This can be done by clicking the fork icon at the right most corner of the github webpage
  2. Clone this forked repo to your local development environment, e.g. your PC at home
  3. Modify the project as you wish. And then create a commit in your local repo
  4. Push your commit to your origin, which is the forked project in your github account
  5. Now your project in github is different from the one you forked from, and you want the original project to accept your commit
  6. So you submit your commit by issuing a "pull request" to the original, but you'll have to wait for the owner's permission to 
     merge your changes into the original project. Good luck!
